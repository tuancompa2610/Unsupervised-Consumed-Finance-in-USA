## About Repository
In this repository I will build a k-means model to cluster US consumers into groups. I also use principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualization, and create an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.

This project was inspired by the lesson I learned in [WQU](https://www.wqu.edu/)
