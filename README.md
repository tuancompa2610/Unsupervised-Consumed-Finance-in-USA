## About Repositorysa
In this repository I will build a k-means model to cluster US consumers into groups. I also use principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualization, and create an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.

This project was inspired by the lesson I learned in [WQU](https://www.wqu.edu/)
## Installation
This is a Jupyter notebook. Package requirements are included in requirement.txt. This project uses Python 3.9. Run the following command in terminal to install the required packages. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
## Useage
The notebook includes all the markdowns which explain the process.
